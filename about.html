            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="bio-bg">
            <p>I am a New Orleans native whose career in public relations, marketing and communications is rooted in the largest city to claim the sights, sounds and effects of Lake Michigan.</p>

            <p>I provide B-to-C as well as B-to-B freelance services in PR, traditional marketing, digital marketing, copy editing, communications and social media content for Global 360 Marketing.</p> 

            <p>Most recently I secured coverage for Chicago Public Schools’ YWLCS on stations ABC, NBC, FOX, WBBM Radio, iHeart Radio, as well as print coverage, for its Girl Power STEM panel.</p>

            <p>Although public relations and marketing are currently the most dominant presence in my life, I am a journalist at heart.  In fact, my professional career began as a writer for a New Orleans newspaper, followed by a reporting position with an Army newspaper in Wildflecken, West Germany, where I earned the US Army Certificate in Journalism.</p> 

            <p>Public relations and marketing are in my blood.  But my true loves are, in this order:  Family, books, biking, news and politics.</p><br>
            <p>And yes ... COFFEE! </p>
